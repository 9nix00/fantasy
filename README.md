A lazy web-framework based on  [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).


## Why use Fantasy

[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a **micro-service** style framework.
It's awesome.

But micro-service framework often cause another problem,
that is make the code reusability not very well.

So can we keep the micro-service architecture and also keep code reusability?

that's why we create fantasy.


Happy Coding with Flask tech-stack, and keep code reusability.



## ChangeLog
